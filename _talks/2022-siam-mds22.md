Abstract
====
During the past years, deep learning has evolved tremendously in the research field of MR image reconstruction. While purely data-driven methods are typically implemented in the image domain and discard the MR acquisition physics entirely, physics-driven methods are the key to the success of learning-based MRI reconstruction. In this talk, I will guide you through the developments of physics-based learning, and introduce you to learned unrolled algorithms. We will connect learned unrolled algorithms to advanced regularization schemes and generative models, and discuss the challenges and caveats of deep learning for image reconstruction. I will showcase real-world examples ranging from 2D musculoskeletal imaging to higher-dimensional cardiac imaging that will underpin the vast potential of learned unrolled algorithms to shape the future of fast MR image acquisition and reconstruction.
