[ISMRM Workshop on
Data Sampling & Image Reconstruction](https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2023/Data/)

Target audience
=====
Researchers who are interested in deep learning methods for non-Cartesian dynamic imaging.

Purpose 
=====
To develop a novel universal k-space interpolation framework for cardiac MR imaging, which avoids the systematic loss of temporal resolution caused by data-binning, and achieves image reconstruction from non-Cartesian k-space data without the need of complex non-uniform Fourier transforms (NUFFT).
