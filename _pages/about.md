Hi there! I'm Wenqi Huang from the chair for AI in Medicine at Technical University of Munich (TUM). I'm a PhD student studying magnetic resonance imaging (on weekdays), a hiking and nature enthusiast (on weekends), and a photographer and/or cyclist (occasionally).


My Research Interest
======
Most of my researches are related to megnatic resonance imaging (MRI). During my master's, I focused on combining low-rankness and sparsity with deep learning to improve the reconstruction quality of dynamic MRI. Recently I gained a lot of interest on self-supervised methods for medical image reconstruction and representation.
